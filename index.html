			During the week of the TSA National Conference, you will be busy doing competitions, attending meetings, and having a good time with the other members at the conference. However, in order to accomplish these tasks, there is a necessary ingredient: food. Unfortunately , food costs money, and the hotel doesn’t come with a free continental breakfast. Here are a few tips on finding satisfaction for both the stomach and mind:	
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Don’t forget your money. Although it sounds obvious, you are going to want the security it provides. As a suggestion, $200 is a good amount of money to take to the National Conference. This provides a solid base to feel safe should anything happen not food related, or provide that one meal to that really cool restaurant in the atrium.
</li>	
			<li>Bring your own food. By packing up a group of essentials to survive, you are already guaranteed to be saving money. Unfortunately there are no grocery stores nearby that can offer you loaves of bread or the college staple of ramen, leaving you to fit as much as you can into your suitcase (or two).
</li>
			<li>Eat out. While there might not be a grocery store nearby, there is the Opry Mills mall, complete with a food court. It provides a cheaper source of food for various meals than can be found in the Gaylord, and includes favorites such as Subway and Panda Express.</li>
			</ul>
